When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Having a remote repository means that you can work from multiple computers in multiple
locations and have others collaborate and push changes to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that your work is not changed by someone else's coding. You need to manually pull so you can resolve any conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
These are similar concepts, but they have distinct differences. A fork is when you duplicate someone else's repository to your own account on GitHub's servers. A clone is when you duplicate a repository from GitHub onto your own computer, or when you duplicate a repository on your own computer, and a branch is when you make a copy of your code separate from 'master' or production. This code can be experimented with to add new features, languages, etc.

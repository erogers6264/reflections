When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Having a remote repository means that you can work from multiple computers in multiple
locations and have others collaborate and push changes to it. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that your work is not changed by someone else's coding. You need to manually pull so you can resolve any conflicts.
